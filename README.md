# @soetji/flow-dnd

A drag and drop library built using [react-dnd](https://react-dnd.github.io). 

This library allows an item to be dropped on empty spaces inside a container.

Currently it supports only items that flows and wraps in the left-to-right direction. In the future it will also support other directions, such as right-to-left, top-to-bottom and bottom-to-top.
